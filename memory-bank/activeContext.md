# Active Context - Current Work Focus

## Current Task Focus

### UI Refinement: shadcn/ui Component Modernization - COMPLETED ✅

**Status**: Completed ✅
**Goal**: Modernize all forms and UI components to use proper shadcn/ui patterns

**Final Implementation**:

- ✅ Installed missing shadcn/ui components (badge, checkbox, switch, sonner, form)
- ✅ Added Toaster component to root layout for global toast notifications
- ✅ Converted reservation form to use proper shadcn/ui Form pattern with FormField components
- ✅ **COMPLETED: Restaurant settings form fully converted to shadcn/ui Form components**
- ✅ Replaced inline status messages with Sonner toast notifications
- ✅ Converted reservation status spans to Badge components
- ✅ Cleaned up unused imports and fixed linting issues
- ✅ All validation tests passed (lint, typecheck, build)

**Key Improvements Delivered**:

1. **Form Consistency**: All forms now use shadcn/ui FormField pattern for better accessibility
2. **Better UX**: Toast notifications provide non-intrusive feedback
3. **Component Standardization**: Badge components for consistent status display
4. **Accessibility**: Proper form labeling and error handling with automatic ARIA attributes
5. **Code Quality**: Removed manual HTML inputs in favor of shadcn/ui components
6. **Type Safety**: Better TypeScript integration with form context
7. **Error Handling**: FormMessage automatically displays validation errors

**Settings Form Conversion Details**:

- Converted all basic information fields to FormField pattern
- Updated opening hours section with proper FormField components
- Converted all reservation settings to use FormField + FormControl pattern
- Removed manual error handling (now handled by FormMessage)
- Maintained existing functionality while improving code quality
- All form validation and submission logic preserved

### Previous Task 26: Enhanced Reservation Cancellation Page

**Status**: Completed ✅
**Goal**: Improve the reservation cancellation page with better UX, confirmation flow, and proper feedback messages

**Completed Implementation**:

- ✅ Created cancellation API endpoint (`/api/reservations/cancel`)
- ✅ Added database query helper (`src/lib/queries/reservation-cancel.ts`)
- ✅ Enhanced cancellation page component with full functionality
- ✅ Updated internationalization messages for all states
- ✅ Implemented confirmation dialog with reservation details display
- ✅ Added "Confirm Cancellation" button with loading states
- ✅ Added optional cancellation reason collection (textarea field)
- ✅ Implemented proper token validation and security handling
- ✅ Added success/error feedback messages
- ✅ All validation tests passed (lint, typecheck, build)

**Key Features Delivered**:

1. **Token Validation**: Secure lookup of reservations by cancel token
2. **Confirmation Dialog**: Prevents accidental cancellations with reservation details
3. **Optional Reason**: Collects cancellation reason for restaurant insights
4. **Loading States**: Proper feedback during API calls
5. **Success/Error Handling**: Clear messaging for all outcomes
6. **Responsive Design**: Mobile-optimized using shadcn/ui components
7. **Security**: Prevents cancellation of past or already cancelled reservations

**Next Priority**: Move to next dashboard development task

- Server-side token verification in reservation API
- Proper error handling for failed verification
- API rejects requests without valid Turnstile tokens

## Current Architecture State

### Database Schema

**Models in Use**:

- `User`: With `isAdmin` field, Clerk integration, soft delete pattern
- `Restaurant`: Full configuration fields (opening hours, constraints, contact info)
- `Reservation`: Complete reservation lifecycle with status management

**Key Relationships**:

- User ←→ Restaurant (Many-to-Many via RestaurantOwners relation)
- Restaurant → Reservations (One-to-Many)
- Secure cancellation tokens for email-based cancellation

### Authentication & Access Control

**Current Implementation**:

- Clerk authentication fully integrated
- Route protection middleware working
- Dashboard routes require authentication
- User-restaurant ownership validation in place
- Netflix-style user lifecycle (soft delete/restore) implemented

### Component System

**Current State**:

- shadcn/ui foundation established
- Custom components in `src/components/ui/*`
- Design tokens system working (`design-tokens.yml` + `tailwind.config.js`)
- Form patterns established with React Hook Form + Zod
- Consistent styling across all components

## Active Development Patterns

### Form Development Pattern

**Established Pattern** (from reservation form):

```typescript
// 1. Zod schema definition
const schema = z.object({...})

// 2. React Hook Form setup
const form = useForm<z.infer<typeof schema>>({
  resolver: zodResolver(schema)
})

// 3. shadcn/ui Form components
<Form>
  <FormField>
    <FormItem>
      <FormLabel />
      <FormControl>
        <Input />
      </FormControl>
      <FormMessage />
    </FormItem>
  </FormField>
</Form>
```

### API Endpoint Pattern

**Established Pattern**:

```typescript
// Response format
{ success: true, data: T } | { success: false, error: string }

// Validation with Zod
const result = schema.safeParse(body)
if (!result.success) {
  return NextResponse.json({ success: false, error: "Validation failed" }, { status: 400 })
}

// Database operations with Prisma
const updated = await prisma.restaurant.update({...})
```

## Key Learnings & Insights

### Server-Side Data Architecture

**Critical Pattern**: Prisma client ONLY on server-side

- Server components: Direct Prisma queries work perfectly
- Client components: Must use fetch() to API routes
- Database queries: Organized in `src/lib/queries/*` for reusability
- This pattern prevents hydration issues and ensures security

### Multi-Tenant Security

**Access Control Pattern**:

- Always validate user-restaurant ownership before data access
- Use restaurant ID consistently in URLs and database queries
- Admin users (`isAdmin: true`) can access all restaurants
- Middleware handles authentication, components handle authorization

### Design System Integration

**Component Development**:

- Always start with shadcn/ui primitives
- Wrap in custom components in `src/components/ui/*` when needed
- Use design tokens from `design-tokens.yml` - never hardcode values
- Maintain consistent spacing, colors, and typography

### Form Validation Strategy

**Dual Validation**:

- Client-side: React Hook Form + Zod for immediate feedback
- Server-side: Same Zod schemas for security and consistency
- Error handling: Clear, user-friendly messages
- Loading states: Proper feedback during async operations

## Current Challenges & Considerations

### Restaurant Settings Complexity

**Challenge**: Opening hours configuration is complex JSON structure
**Approach**: Use Zod for type-safe validation of nested JSON structure
**Pattern**: `{ "monday": [{"start": "09:00", "end": "17:00"}], ... }`

### Form State Management

**Challenge**: Loading existing restaurant data into form
**Approach**: Use React Hook Form's `reset()` method after data fetch
**Pattern**: Server component loads data, passes to client form component

### API Route Organization

**Current**: `/api/restaurants/[restaurantId]/route.ts` exists
**Need**: PATCH method for updating restaurant settings
**Pattern**: Validate ownership, parse body with Zod, update with Prisma

## Testing Credentials

**Dashboard Access**:

- Email: `aldebaran.desombergh@yeety.be`
- Password: `.G?u+>8d7C&xiy*`
- Role: Restaurant owner with access to test restaurant

## Next Session Priorities

1. **Complete Task 25**: Settings form validation and save functionality
2. **Validate Implementation**: Ensure all validation steps pass
3. **Test End-to-End**: Use test credentials to verify complete flow
4. **Move to Task 26**: Enhanced reservation cancellation page

## Important Context for Memory Resets

**Critical Files to Check**:

- `src/components/ui/restaurant-settings-form.tsx` - Current form structure
- `src/app/api/restaurants/[restaurantId]/route.ts` - API endpoint for updates
- `src/lib/schemas/restaurant-settings.ts` - Zod validation schema
- `docs/tasks/025-settings-form-validation-and-save.md` - Task requirements

**Key Patterns to Remember**:

- Server-side Prisma queries only
- shadcn/ui component foundation
- React Hook Form + Zod validation
- Design tokens for all styling
- Multi-tenant security validation

This active context ensures continuity across memory resets and maintains focus on current development priorities.
