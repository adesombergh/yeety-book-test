# 011.1 â€“ Mock Restaurant Data

## Goal

Create mock restaurant data in the database using Prisma seed script to enable testing and development of restaurant-related features.

## Deliverable

- `prisma/seed.ts` - Seed script with realistic mock restaurant data
- Updated `package.json` with seed script command
- Mock data includes all Restaurant model fields:
  - `slug` (unique, URL-friendly identifiers)
  - `name` (realistic restaurant names)
  - `emailContact` and `phoneContact` (contact information)
  - `openingHours` (JSON with weekly schedule)
  - Reservation constraints: `slotInterval`, `minGuestsPerReservation`, etc.
  - `subscriptionStatus` (active/inactive states)

## Validation

- `pnpm prisma db seed` runs successfully without errors
- Database contains at least 3 mock restaurant records
- All mock data follows the Restaurant model schema exactly
- Opening hours JSON is properly formatted and realistic
- `pnpm lint`, `pnpm typecheck` pass for seed file
- Seed script is idempotent (can be run multiple times safely)
