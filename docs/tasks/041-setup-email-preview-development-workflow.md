- Add email preview script to `package.json` (e.g., `email:dev` or `email:preview`)
- Create or update email development documentation in project
- Ensure email templates in `src/components/emails/` are discoverable by preview server
- Configure preview server to work with project's TypeScript and component structure

## Validation

- `pnpm lint`, `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm build` all succeed
- `pnpm email:dev` (or equivalent) command starts email preview server successfully
- All email templates are visible and accessible in preview interface
- Email preview updates automatically when templates are modified
- Preview server runs without conflicts with main development server
- Email templates render correctly in preview with proper styling and data
