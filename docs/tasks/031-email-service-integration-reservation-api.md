# 031 – Email Service Integration with Reservation API

## Goal

Integrate confirmation email sending into the reservation creation API endpoint with non-blocking email operations and proper error handling.

## Deliverable

- Enhanced `src/app/api/reservations/route.ts` with email integration
- `sendReservationConfirmation()` method implementation in email service
- Non-blocking email sending that never fails reservation creation
- Calendar invite attachment (.ics file) included in confirmation emails
- Proper error logging for email failures without blocking API response
- Email sending triggered after successful reservation database insert
- From address configured as `no-reply@yeety.be`

## Validation

- `pnpm lint` → succeeds without errors
- `pnpm typecheck` → passes TypeScript validation
- `pnpm build` → builds successfully
- Reservation creation API continues to work normally
- Confirmation email is sent after successful reservation creation
- Calendar invite attachment is included in email
- Email failures do not prevent reservation creation success
- API returns success response even if email sending fails
