# 010.5 – Authentication route architecture

## Goal

Define and organize the authentication route structure and protected route groups to establish a clear foundation for future authentication implementation.

## Deliverable

- Authentication route architecture documented in `docs/auth-architecture.md`
- Route protection groups clearly defined (public vs protected routes)
- Placeholder auth-related pages created with proper routing structure:
  - `/sign-in` page with placeholder content
  - `/sign-up` page with placeholder content
- Protected route structure validated (dashboard routes remain accessible for now)
- Internationalized placeholder content for auth pages
- Clear documentation of which routes will require authentication

## Validation

- `pnpm lint`, `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm build` all succeed
- Navigate to `/en/sign-in` → shows "Sign In" placeholder page
- Navigate to `/en/sign-up` → shows "Sign Up" placeholder page
- All existing routes continue to work without authentication requirements
- Documentation clearly defines public vs protected route groups
- Auth pages use shadcn/ui components and design tokens

## Accepted
