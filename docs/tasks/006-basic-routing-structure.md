- `/dashboard` page created with static placeholder content
- Proper file structure following Next.js App Router conventions
- Basic navigation between pages working
- Multi-tenant URL structure established with restaurant slug parameter

## Validation

- Navigating to `/dashboard` shows dashboard placeholder page
- Both pages render without errors
- Restaurant slug parameter is properly captured and accessible
