# 038 â€“ Add Cursor Pointer to Button Component

## Goal

Fix button component styling to include proper cursor pointer for better user experience and visual feedback.

## Deliverable

- Update `src/components/ui/button.tsx` to include `cursor-pointer` class in button variants
- Ensure all button variants (default, destructive, outline, secondary, ghost, link) have proper cursor styling
- Test button component across different states (default, disabled, loading)
- Maintain existing button functionality and styling
- Ensure disabled buttons have appropriate cursor behavior (not pointer)

## Validation

- `pnpm lint`, `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm build` all succeed
- All buttons show pointer cursor on hover when enabled
- Disabled buttons maintain appropriate cursor (not pointer)
- Cancellation screens and all other button usages show proper cursor behavior
- Button component maintains all existing variants and functionality
- No regression in button styling or behavior
