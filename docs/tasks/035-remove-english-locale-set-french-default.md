# 035 â€“ Remove English Locale and Set French as Default

## Goal

Configure the application to use only French locale, removing English support entirely to streamline the internationalization setup.

## Deliverable

- Update `src/i18n/routing.ts` to only include 'fr' locale
- Set French as default locale in routing configuration
- Remove `messages/en.json` file from the project
- Update any locale references in middleware or configuration files
- Ensure all locale-dependent code works with French-only setup

## Validation

- `pnpm lint`, `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm build` all succeed
- Application loads in French by default without locale prefix
- No English locale references remain in codebase
- Routing works correctly with French as the only supported locale
- All internationalized components render French text properly
