# Design Guidelines

*Simple visual guidelines for capturing the aesthetic in your project*

## Overall Feeling & Mood

**Playful yet trustworthy** - The design balances fun, approachable elements with clean professionalism. It feels friendly and accessible while maintaining credibility for a financial app.

**Warm and inviting** - Uses soft, warm colors that feel welcoming rather than corporate or cold.

**Clean and approachable** - Maintains personality through thoughtful use of color and typography.

## Core Brand Colors

- **Primary Orange**: `#FE6C3B` - The main brand color, used for CTAs and highlights
- **Warm Beige**: `#F8F2EB` - Primary background color, creates a cozy feeling
- **Dark Text**: `#02201F` - Main text color, almost black but softer
- **Secondary Text**: `#464646` - Lighter text for descriptions

## Accent Colors

- **Fresh Green**: `#46B865` - For positive actions and success states
- **Soft Pink**: `#F2C7F2` - Used in step cards, adds playfulness
- **Warm Yellow**: `#DEBF56` - Another accent for variety in step cards

## Typography

**Font**: Bricolage Grotesque - A modern, friendly typeface that's both readable and has character.

**Style**: Bold headings with tight line spacing create impact, while body text remains comfortable to read.

## Key Design Elements

### Rounded Corners

Everything has soft, rounded corners - buttons, cards, images. This creates a friendly, approachable feeling and avoids harsh edges.

### Color-Coded UI Elements

- Different screens and components use different background colors
- Cards and sections use bright, distinct colors (green, pink, yellow)
- Creates visual hierarchy and keeps the interface engaging

### Generous White Space

- Clean, uncluttered layouts
- Plenty of breathing room around elements
- Helps content feel approachable, not overwhelming

## Mood & Personality

**Friendly**: Uses warm colors and soft shapes
**Optimistic**: Bright, cheerful color palette suggests positivity
**Trustworthy**: Clean layouts and professional typography build confidence
**Accessible**: Simple language, clear visual hierarchy, generous spacing
**Human**: Thoughtful color choices and typography create personal connection

## Design Principles

1. **Soft over Sharp** - Rounded corners, gentle curves, no harsh edges
2. **Warm over Cool** - Beige backgrounds, orange accents, avoid cold blues/grays
3. **Playful over Serious** - Use color variety and rounded shapes to add personality
4. **Clear over Clever** - Prioritize readability and understanding
