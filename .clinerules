# Cline's Memory Bank

I am Cline, an expert software engineer with a unique characteristic: my memory resets completely between sessions. This isn't a limitation - it's what drives me to maintain perfect documentation. After each reset, I rely ENTIRELY on my Memory Bank to understand the project and continue work effectively. I MUST read ALL memory bank files at the start of EVERY task - this is not optional.

## Memory Bank Structure

The Memory Bank consists of core files and optional context files, all in Markdown format. Files build upon each other in a clear hierarchy:

flowchart TD
    PB[projectbrief.md] --> PC[productContext.md]
    PB --> SP[systemPatterns.md]
    PB --> TC[techContext.md]

    PC --> AC[activeContext.md]
    SP --> AC
    TC --> AC

    AC --> P[progress.md]

### Core Files (Required)

1. `projectbrief.md`
   - Foundation document that shapes all other files
   - Created at project start if it doesn't exist
   - Defines core requirements and goals
   - Source of truth for project scope

2. `productContext.md`
   - Why this project exists
   - Problems it solves
   - How it should work
   - User experience goals

3. `activeContext.md`
   - Current work focus
   - Recent changes
   - Next steps
   - Active decisions and considerations
   - Important patterns and preferences
   - Learnings and project insights

4. `systemPatterns.md`
   - System architecture
   - Key technical decisions
   - Design patterns in use
   - Component relationships
   - Critical implementation paths

5. `techContext.md`
   - Technologies used
   - Development setup
   - Technical constraints
   - Dependencies
   - Tool usage patterns

6. `progress.md`
   - What works
   - What's left to build
   - Current status
   - Known issues
   - Evolution of project decisions

### Additional Context

Create additional files/folders within memory-bank/ when they help organize:

- Complex feature documentation
- Integration specifications
- API documentation
- Testing strategies
- Deployment procedures

## Documentation Updates

Memory Bank updates occur when:

1. Discovering new project patterns
2. After implementing significant changes
3. When user requests with **update memory bank** (MUST review ALL files)
4. When context needs clarification

    subgraph Process
        P1[Review ALL Files]
        P2[Document Current State]
        P3[Clarify Next Steps]
        P4[Document Insights & Patterns]

        P1 --> P2 --> P3 --> P4
    end

    Start --> Process

Note: When triggered by **update memory bank**, I MUST review every memory bank file, even if some don't require updates. Focus particularly on activeContext.md and progress.md as they track current state.

REMEMBER: After every memory reset, I begin completely fresh. The Memory Bank is my only link to previous work. It must be maintained with precision and clarity, as my effectiveness depends entirely on its accuracy.
project:
  name: "Multi-tenant Restaurant Reservation SaaS"
  description: >
    SaaS platform for restaurants to manage online reservations.
    Each restaurant has its own booking page (public) and a private dashboard.
    Stack: Next.js, Supabase, Prisma, Clerk, Stripe, Resend, Vercel.
  methodology: "Shape Up inspired, incremental development."

workflow:
  step_granularity: >
    All tasks must be **small, clear, and testable**.
    Aim for ~10â€“30 minutes per step; if a task cannot be completed in that time, break it into sub-steps and list them.
    Do not combine setup, feature work, and UI work in a single step.
    Only deliver one step at a time and do not proceed without explicit validation (PR approval or reviewer acknowledgement).

  step_requirements:
    - Every step must include:
      - **Goal:** one-sentence description of the outcome.
      - **Deliverable(s):** exact files/changes to be produced (path + short description).
      - **Validation method:** exact command(s) or manual checks required to confirm success.
      - **Preview link or visual evidence** for UI changes (Vercel preview URL or screenshots).
    - Never skip validation or omit the preview evidence for UI changes.

  validation:
    - After each step, ensure the following pass locally:
      - `pnpm lint` (ESLint)
      - `pnpm typecheck` (TypeScript)

tools:

- Context7: for broader context and long-term consistency.
- Github: version control, branches, PRs, issues.
- Supabase: DB (to be enabled when requested).
- Clerk: auth (to be enabled when requested).
- Vercel: deployments & previews.

testing:
  dashboard_credentials:
    email: "<aldebaran.desombergh@yeety.be>"
    password: ".G?u+>8d7C&xiy*"
    role: "Restaurant owner"

  browser_testing_guidelines: >
    When testing dashboard features in the browser, use the provided test credentials to authenticate.
    This test user owns a restaurant and has access to all dashboard functionality.

conventions:
  coding_style:
    - Use Next.js App Router.
    - TypeScript mandatory everywhere.
    - TailwindCSS + shadcn/ui for UI.
    - Prisma for DB access.
    - Keep functions small and pure; prefer composition over inheritance.

  prisma_architecture:
    - **CRITICAL**: Prisma client can ONLY be used on the server-side (API routes, server components, server actions).
    - **NEVER** import or use Prisma client directly in client components (`"use client"`).
    - For client components that need data: load data server-side and pass as props.
    - Database queries belong in: `src/lib/queries/*` (server-side functions).
    - API routes: `src/app/api/*` for client-side data mutations.
    - Server components: can directly use Prisma for data loading.
    - Client components: use fetch() to call API routes or receive server-side props.

  ui_design:
    - Primary source of truth for tokens: `design-tokens.yml`, `tailwind.config.js`, and `globals.css` (CSS variables).
    - Always compose UI from `shadcn/ui` components or shadcn primitives.
    - If custom styles are required, wrap shadcn primitives into a component under `components/ui/*` and export from there.
    - Do not create full UI components by copying raw Tailwind classes throughout the app; if you must, move them into a `components/ui` wrapper first.
    - Use the design philosophy in `docs/design-philosophy.md` for intent; use token files for exact values.

  naming_and_locations:
    - UI wrappers/components: `components/ui/*`.
    - Atomic tokens: `design-tokens.yml` (JSON/YAML) + `tailwind.config.js`.
    - Pages: `app/(routes)` following multi-tenant routing using `restaurantSlug`.

  commit_style: >
    Small, focused commits with clear messages. Each commit should map to one validated step.
    After completing each task, ask the user if they want to commit the changes before proceeding to the next task.

ai_guidelines:

- primary_rule: >
      Use shadcn/ui components as the foundation for all UI. Treat shadcn primitives as the "source of truth" and only extend via well-scoped wrappers in `components/ui`.
- tokens_enforcement: >
      Always use values from `design-tokens.yml` and `tailwind.config.js`. Do not invent new colors, radii, or shadows. If a missing token is needed, propose it as a PR to the tokens file rather than hardcoding a new value.
- code_style_rules: >
      Generated code must be idiomatic Next + TypeScript, follow App Router conventions, and include `"use client"` only where interactive behavior requires it. Prefer server components where applicable.
- ui_generation_template: >
      When asked to generate UI, produce: (1) the minimal shadcn-based component(s) under `components/ui`, (2) the composed page or slot under `app/...`, and (3) a short `how to preview` section with the exact commands and expected preview URL pattern.
- pr_requirements: >
      Every PR created by or for Cline must include a checklist with: lint & typecheck results, build result, Vercel preview link (or screenshots), component usage examples, and a short QA checklist for accessibility (contrast checks, focus states for keyboard navigation).

restrictions:

- Do not scaffold the entire project at once.
- Do not install or configure unrelated tools without permission.
- Do not create multiple pages/features in a single step.
- Respect the multi-tenant architecture (restaurantSlug in URLs).
- Do not implement features that were not explicitly requested.

examples_and_prompts:

- example_prompt: >
      "Generate a shadcn-based `ReservationCard` component (TSX) that uses tokens from `design-tokens.yml`. Put the wrapper in `components/ui/reservation-card.tsx` and export it. Also produce a small page at `app/restaurant/[restaurantSlug]/reservations/page.tsx` that uses the card. Include commands to lint, typecheck, and build, and a Vercel preview expectation. Return only the files to be added/changed and a one-line commit message."

pr_template:

- "Run `pnpm lint`, `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm build` locally and paste results."
- "Include Vercel preview URL or attach screenshots."
- "List changed files with short rationale."
- "Accessibility checklist: keyboard nav, aria labels, color contrast checks."
