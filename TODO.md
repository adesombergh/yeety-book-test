TODO:

- Reservation Hour Select: Remove hours where restaurant is closed
- Reservation Hour Select: disable hours where no slots are available
- Reservation Hour Select: create a route to fetch the available slots for a specific day
- Reservation Hour Select: Hide input while date is not chosen and fetch for availability is loading
- Investigate time difference between the one in the reservation, the one in the email and the one in the ics file
- Replace word "Restaurant" by "Etablissement"
- Restaurant Dashboard: Add a "Visit reservation page" link, and a share button.
- Add restaurant logo.

TO_THINK:

- should reservations be manually validated by restaurant first? Add option to do it?
- service coupéééé
